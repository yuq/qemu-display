RDP server for
[org.qemu.Display1](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/interop/dbus-display.html)
interface (as exposed by `qemu -display dbus`).

The project was originally designed to work with QEMU, but it can be used with
other displays/UI that implement the D-Bus interface.

## Features

- RDP server in Rust thanks to IronRDP
- using TLS/CredSSP for secure connections
- text clipboard sharing
- audio playback
- monitor resize
- remotefx image codec
- Opus audio codec (works with some clients, like FreeRDP)

## Installation & usage

```
cargo install qemu-rdp
```

To run the server against qemu, the simplest way is to use `qemu -display dbus` and
run the server: (requires certificate and key)
```bash
qemu-rdp serve --bind-address YOUR_IP:3389 --cert=CERT.PEM --key=KEY.PEM
```

Although for a complete setup (with audio devices, clipboard and such), you may
want to wait for libvirt to support it.

## TODO

Some ideas to improve the project:

- [ ] some video/image codec (AV1/AVC/HEVC)
- [ ] USB redirection
- [ ] audio recording
- [ ] more types clipboard redirection
- [ ] file system redirection
- [ ] multimonitor
- tons of other stuff from RDP features, and a lot of bug fixes🐛
